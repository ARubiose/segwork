""" Trainer class 

Template design pattern: https://refactoring.guru/es/design-patterns/template-method/python/example
The Template Method lets you turn a monolithic algorithm into a series of individual 
steps which can be easily extended by subclasses while keeping intact the structure defined in a superclass.
Itâ€™s okay if all the steps end up being abstract. However, some steps might benefit from having a default implementation.
